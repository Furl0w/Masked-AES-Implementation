This is a folder for the opensource code of Masked AES implementations. This folder include three different masked AES implementations:
(1) Byte-wise boolean masked AES.
(2) Bit-sliced AES
(2) Bit-sliced masked AES. 

Anyone who uses these opensource AES implementations in their publications, please cite the paper:
Yao, Yuan, Mo Yang, Conor Patrick, Bilgiday Yuce, and Patrick Schaumont. "Fault-assisted side-channel analysis of masked implementations." In 2018 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST), pp. 57-64. IEEE, 2018.
